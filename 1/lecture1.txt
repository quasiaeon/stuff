dy/dx (approx.) = delta y / delta x

=> delta v / delta t = g

   We assume that when t=0, v=0. In order to find delta v, we choose an arbitrary delta t, for instance, delta t = 1 [s].
   Thus:
   v(t_0 + delta t) - v(t_0) / delta t = g

   v(t_0 + delta t) = v(t_0) + delta t * g = 9.8 [m/s];

   Following this, delta t remains 1 s, however, t_0 = t_1 and t_1 = t_2, i.e., t_i = 1 [s] and t_i_+_1 = 2 [s].
   In order to find x(t), integration could be used, however, the following expression is more computationally viable.
   Assuming x_0 = 0:
   x = x_0 + v * t

   Protocol questions:
   1) no difference is noted / the smaller dt one
   2) no, the formula remains the same, therefore nothing different is done computational wise.

   t_theoretical = 2v_0 / g
